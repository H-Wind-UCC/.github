# Wind-to-Hydrogen Toolkit

[Wind-to-Hydrogen Toolkit](https://github.com/wind-to-hydrogen-toolkit) is a collection of computer programmes developed by researchers in the H-Wind and HyFloat1 projects at the [MaREI Centre](https://www.marei.ie/), [University College Cork (UCC)](https://www.ucc.ie/en/).

We expect that these tools will be of benefit to project developers, students, and other researchers to work on green hydrogen systems.
As work is peer reviewed, we will release these tools for public use as a durable output of the H-Wind and HyFloat1 projects.

## H-Wind: Hydrogen from offshore wind

[H-Wind](https://www.marei.ie/project/h-wind/) is a MaREI Centre industry-led collaborative research project on the production of green hydrogen from offshore wind farms.

The H-Wind project was supported by a research grant from [Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)](https://www.sfi.ie/) under Grant No. 12/RC/2302 â€“ P2 and by the industry consortium members: [DP Energy](https://dpenergy.com/), [Equinor](https://www.equinor.com/), [ESB](https://esb.ie/), and [Gas Networks Ireland](https://www.gasnetworks.ie/).

## HyFloat1: Concept development of floating offshore wind foundations coupled with hydrogen storage

The [HyFloat1](https://www.seai.ie/data-and-insights/seai-research/research-database/research-projects/details/hyfloat1:-concept-development-of-floating-offshore-wind-foundations-coupled-with-hydrogen-storage) project aims at developing new concepts for floating offshore wind foundations coupled with hydrogen storage.

The HyFloat1 project was supported by a research grant from the [Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI)](https://www.seai.ie).
