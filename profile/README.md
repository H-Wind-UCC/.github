# Wind-to-Hydrogen Toolkit

[Wind-to-Hydrogen Toolkit](https://github.com/wind-to-hydrogen-toolkit) is a collection of tools developed by researchers in the H-Wind, HyFloat1, and HyFloatComp projects at the [MaREI Centre](https://www.marei.ie/), [University College Cork (UCC)](https://www.ucc.ie/en/) to study the integration of offshore wind with the production, storage, and utilisation of hydrogen.

We expect that these tools will be of benefit to project developers, students, and other researchers to work on green hydrogen systems.
As work is peer reviewed, we will release these tools for public use as a durable output of the H-Wind, HyFloat1, and HyFloatComp projects.

See <https://wind-to-hydrogen-toolkit.github.io> for more details.
